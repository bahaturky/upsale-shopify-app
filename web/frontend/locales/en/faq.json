    {
      "q": "What is this Upsell App ?",
      "a": "Upsell is a popup that will be triggered by your customer once they click on \"add to cart\".  The popup will consist of products you will have chosen earlier that could be bought with the product (coffee bags is a nice upsell to a coffee machine) or that could simply be a better product (a better coffee machine). Out of all the popup we've tried, Upsell is the most powerful and simple sales funnel app."
